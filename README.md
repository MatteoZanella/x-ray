# Classification of X-ray images

The objective of this project is to compare algorithms to identify, given a thoracic x-ray image as input, the potential presence of illnesses. 

The illnesses that we target are 3 and are named: 
* viral infection
* bacterial infection
* COVID-19

## Traditional ML Algorithms
* Decision Tree Classifier (DT)
* Random Forest (RF)
* Nearest Neghbour Classifier (NN)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
